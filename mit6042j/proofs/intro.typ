= Introduction

Simply put, a proof is a method of establishing truth. Like beauty, “truth” sometimes depends on the eye of the beholder, and it should not be surprising that what constitutes a proof differs among fields.

Mathematics has its own specific notion of "proof".


#noindent[
  *Definition.* A _mathematical proof_ of a _proposition_ is a chain of _logical deductions_ leading to the proposition from a base set of _axioms_.
]
The three key ideas in this definition are highlighted: _proposition_, _logical deduction_, and _axiom_.
